            A BlueApron like website, but with its own diffrences and
            advantages, it is made with FastApi,sqlalchemy, alembic, docker
            ...ect for backend, and Reactjs, redux, tailwind, for the frontend.
            <br />
            I spent few weeks developing it, and it is soon going to production.

            During Covid pandemic in 2019, a group of Algerian students decided
            to do their best, to guide charities arround Algeria, to be as
            effective as possible, in helping the weak and needy people, i made
            the website
            <a class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold" href="www.chabakat.team">
              chabakat.team</a
            >
            using python with Flask. <br />
            the idea was most effective Via facebook, as we could help many
            familles, yet as a developer i learned one my best lessons in
            developing this website, <br />
            ~ check what is really needed first ~ the website was barely used
            and that was because people were not really adapted to the use of
            such websites, facebook and messages simpy were much more effective.
            <br />
            the website is no longer active but you can take a tour in it.
            <br />
            use
            <span class="text-xl text-blue-600"> 0600000000:0600000000 </span>
            to access

            An NLP model made specifically for the Algerian Local dialect, first
            part of the project was my graduation thesis were me and my friend
            made the larget sentiment analysis dataset, with a webapp to
            manually label extracted comments from algerian youtube channels.
            <br />
            The second part is the pretrained model, which will be tranined on
            about 12 million comments and replies extracted from Algerian
            youtube channels, the model was be trained using masked language
            modeling, and next sentence predition, and will very likely be open
            sourced soon.

            WI-SAT is small hotspot network that i build from scratch, it has a small real time QOE and QOS (qos and
            que gets updated based on few metrics) system that allows people to
            get the best experience out of their available bandwidth (or Wi-Fi airtime). <br />
            it leverages the power of Mikrotik and Ubiquiti, and it is my best
            computer network experience so far.
