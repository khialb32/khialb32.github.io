          A BlueApron like website, but with its own diffrences and advantages,
          it is made with FastApi,sqlalchemy, alembic ...ect for backend, and
          Reactjs, redux, tailwind ..ect, for the frontend. <br />
          I spent few weeks developing it, and it is soon going to production,
          use demo:demo to access the website, and test it.

          During Covid pandemic in 2019, a group of Algerian students decided to
          do their best, to guide charities arrount Algeria, to be as effective
          as possible, in helping the weak and needy people, i made the website
          <a class="text-blue-600 text-xl font-bold" href="www.chabakat.team">
            chabakat.team</a
          >
          using Flask,sqlalchemy,...ect, <br />
          the idea was most effective Via facebook, as we could help many
          familles, yet as a developer i learned one my best lessons in
          developing websites, <br />
          ~ check what is really needed first ~ the website was barely used and
          that was because people were not really adapted to the use of such
          websites, facebook and messages simpy were much more effective. <br />
          the website is no longer active but you can use demo:demo to take a
          tour in it.

          An NLP model made specifically for the Algerian Local dialect, first
          part of the project was my graduation thesis were me and my friend
          made the larget sentiment analysis dataset, manually labeled comments
          extracted from algerian youtube channels. <br />
          The second part is the pretrained model, which will be tranined on
          about 12 million comments and replies extracted from Algerian youtube
          channels, the model should be trained using masked language modeling,
          and next sentence predition.
